This was a submission for the Weizmann Institute's 2017 International Physics Convention. 
The submission was a box containing two seperate "physics riddles": a gyroscope and a set of wiring
challenges.

These are the two codes for the riddles. The gyroscope code uses a series of photoresistors to
ascertain whether or not the gyroscope has been properly spun. The resistor code checks input to
tell if the resistor has been set up correctly.
